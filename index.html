<h3>Coding</h3>
<p>Before IIT, I havn't any idea about coding. The course of COL100 gave me an opportunity to learn and invent a skill of myself. After this, I have developed a keen interest in coding and programming. The lecture of Android Developing of Dev Club attracted me very much.So I began to improve my coding skill.</p>

<h3>A Good player</h3>
<p>In last few year of the preparation of JEE, I had almost forgotten about playing. At IIT, I began to concentrate on my old interest i.e. playing. I became a good player of Badminton. Sometimes I also used to play table tenis.</p>
